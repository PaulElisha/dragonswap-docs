# Fee Tiers in Dragonswap

Dragonswap V2 introduces flexible fee tiers tailored to different types of trading pairs:





0.05%: Designed for stable pairs (e.g., USDC/DAI) with low volatility and high correlation.



0.3%: Suitable for standard pairs (e.g., ETH/USDC) with moderate volatility.



1%: Reserved for exotic or highly volatile pairs with increased risk.

These tiers allow liquidity providers (LPs) to align their fee structure with the risk and volatility of the assets they are supporting.
