# Dragonswap V2

Dragonswap V2 significantly enhances capital efficiency by introducing individualized price curves for liquidity providers (LPs). Unlike Dragonswap V2, where liquidity is distributed uniformly across a price curve for a general pool, Dragonswap V2 allows LPs to concentrate their liquidity within specific price ranges. This means users can provide liquidity at precise price points, maximizing its utilization and earning potential.

In Dragonswap V2, trades occur against the combined liquidity available at a specific price point. If the market price moves outside the defined range of a user's liquidity position, that liquidity is no longer active unless the user adjusts it to the new price range. This dynamic feature ensures efficient allocation of capital.

Dragonswap V2 also introduces range limit orders, enabling users to provide liquidity above or below the current market price. When the market price moves into the selected range, the position is effectively executed. Additionally, LPs can create multiple positions across different price ranges, providing flexibility to manage risk and capture opportunities at varying price levels.

To represent these customized liquidity positions, Dragonswap V2 utilizes non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These NFTs embody the unique attributes of each position, such as the specific price range and the amount of liquidity provided. 

Another notable improvement is the flexibility in trading fees. LPs can choose pools with different fee tiers, allowing them to align their investments with their risk tolerance and trading strategies. This adaptive structure makes Dragonswap V2 a more sophisticated and capital-efficient platform for decentralized trading and liquidity provision.
